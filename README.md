# Caesar Cipher Tool 🔐

This project is part of my Cybersecurity Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.

## 🚀 Task Objective
Implement Caesar Cipher in Python that:
- Encrypts and decrypts messages
- Takes user input and shift value

## 🧪 How It Works
- Letters are shifted forward or backward in the alphabet by a fixed amount (shift value).
- Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

## 🛠️ Usage
```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
